MusicBrainz MassTagger
======================

A Mass Metadata Tagger for audio files using the MusicBrainz Web Service.

The aim is to do what MB Picard does, but with no user interation, and with
the ability to work on thousands of files in one automatic session.

To use, you'll need the following dependencies:

- libmusicbrainz v5 (download from http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libmusicbrainz
  and install with CMake)
- libtag v1.8 (sudo apt-get install libtag1-dev)
- libneon v2.7 (sudo apt-get install libneon27-gnutils-dev)
